# Git example

This is an example about the basic things of Git. I will show some basic commands.

The we will study what is a **branch** in Git.

## .gitignore file

Add here all the files and folders, which you don't want to have in the repository.

## Git Conflict

Conflict appears when you are trying to merge and there is two different versions on the same line of some file.

## Pull requests

Good way to work in a team is that nobody push directly to main. Instead they make a new branch every time they want to make a new feature. When they are ready with the feature they push that branch to GitHub and make a Pull Request.

Then somebody else (or the team) will check the feature and either accept and deny the new version. If they accept, they Merge the branch to main.

Then everyone in the Team will Pull the latest version of main.
